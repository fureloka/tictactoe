# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game, programmed with C++ and SDL2.  
Originally a first time C++ game project, finished back in 2013 (With a broken AI and way over my head attempt at adding OpenGL).

## To compile and run you need these packages:

- CMake 2.8+
- Clang 3.3+ OR GCC 4.8.1+
- SDL2 2.0+
- SDL2-ttf 2.0+
	
## Compiling:
```
git clone https://github.com/fureloka/tictactoe.git
cd tictactoe
cmake .
make
```

This will build the binary and output it to the bin directory.

## Running:
```
cd bin
./TicTacToe
```

## Controls
CTRL + N: New Game  
CTRL + A: Activate AI / Deactivate AI  
CTRL + Q: Quit
