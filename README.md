TicTacToe
=========
A simple TicTacToe game, programmed with C++ and SDL2. 
Originally a first time C++ game project, finished back in 2013 (With a broken AI and way over my head attempt at adding OpenGL).

Task that I've decided to do now, before letting it rest:
- [x] Remove the broken attempt at adding OpenGL, and replace it with SDL2 (DONE)
- [ ] Fix the broken AI (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Check for potential memory leaks (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Maybe add some sensible error handling (TBD)
- [ ] Update README with how to compile and play.
