TicTacToe
=========
A simple TicTacToe game, programmed with C++ and SDL2. 
Originally a first time C++ game project, finished back in 2013 (With a broken AI and way over my head attempt at adding OpenGL).

Tasks that I've decided to do now, before letting it rest:
- [x] Remove the broken attempt at adding OpenGL, and replace it with SDL2 (DONE)
- [x] Fix the broken AI (DONE)
- [x] Check for potential memory leaks (DONE)
- [x] Add a statement that checks if the board is full (DONE)
- [ ] Add some sensible error handling (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Update README with how to compile and play.
